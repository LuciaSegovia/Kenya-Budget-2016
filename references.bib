  abstract = {By analyzing the food consumption data from the 2008/09 Pesquisa de Or{\c c}amentos Familiares in Brazil, we demonstrate that failing to account for food consumed for free at school may significantly distort the assessment of the distribution of food consumption among households and therefore the assessment of the extent of food insecurity in the country. The results of our analysis enabled a revision of the FAO estimate of the Prevalence of Undernourishment in Brazil and provide useful suggestions for better design of food consumption modules to be included in Household Consumption and Expenditure Surveys (HCES). Additionally, we identify areas for further research on food consumption data to improve national food security assessments.},

  abstract = {Large-scale food fortification may be a cost-effective intervention to increase micronutrient supplies in the food system when implemented under appropriate conditions, yet it is unclear if current strategies can equitably benefit populations with the greatest micronutrient needs. This study developed a mathematical modeling framework for comparing fortification scenarios across different contexts. It was applied to model the potential contributions of three fortification vehicles (oil, sugar, and wheat flour) toward meeting dietary micronutrient requirements in Malawi through secondary data analyses of a Household Consumption and Expenditure Survey. We estimated fortification vehicle coverage, micronutrient density of the diet, and apparent intake of nonpregnant, nonlactating women for nine different micronutrients, under three food fortification scenarios and stratified by subpopulations across seasons. Oil and sugar had high coverage and apparent consumption that, when combined, were predicted to improve the vitamin A adequacy of the diet. Wheat flour contributed little to estimated dietary micronutrient supplies due to low apparent consumption. Potential contributions of all fortification vehicles were low in rural populations of the lowest socioeconomic position. While the model predicted large-scale food fortification would contribute to reducing vitamin A inadequacies, other interventions are necessary to meet other micronutrient requirements, especially for the rural poor.},
