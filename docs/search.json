    "text": "1.2 Adjusting the Energy requirments to food allocation\nSome adjustment are needed when using the energy requirements to allocate the food consumed at the household level, for example, if an infant is exclusive breastfed, no food will be given to them, hence we will adjust their energy needs to zero. In other words, there will be no food allocated to the infant. Similarly, there are other cases when the food allocation (based on the energy) would need to be modifed, for instance, if children receive food at the school Borlizzi, Delgrossi, and Cafiero (2017).\nThis is also calculated using a function Energy_adjustments(). Like in the other function, some of this modules can be used or not based on the information available and/or the country context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote on assumptions\n\n\n\nSummary of the main function assumptions/ decisions:\n\nexcl.bf: (TRUE) energy adjustment for infants with exclusive breastfeeding.\nexcl.age: Exclusive breastfeeding was assumed only for infants of &lt;= 3months.\ncomple.bf: (TRUE) energy adjustment for infants with complementary breastfeeding (6-11months).\nprev.complebf: In infant (12-24months), complementary breastfeeding was adjusted based on 60% prevalence.\nschool: (TRUE) energy adjustment for all the School Age Children (SAC, 6-13 yo) that attended school based on receiving one meal each school day.
